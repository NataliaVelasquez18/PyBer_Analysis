# PyBer Analysis

## OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

### Description:

In this project we will be performing an exploratory analysis on large csv files.   We will analyze all the rideshare data of PyBer, a ride-sharing app company, from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualizations for the CEO to help drive strategy.

### Purpose:

The purpose of the analysis is to create visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.


### Current situation:

PYber is a python based ride-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion.  The CEO of the company needs the analysis to make strategic decisions regarding affordability for certain neighborhoods.

### Overview of approach:

Using Pandas library, Jupiter Notebook, and Matplotlib we were able to read, merge, and create visualizations of two large csv files located on the Resources folder; city_data.csv and ride_data.csv. The charts created show the relationship between the type of city and drivers, riders, and fares.  These visualizations are located on the analysis and Resources folders.
