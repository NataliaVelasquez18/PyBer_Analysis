# PyBer Analysis

## OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

### Description:

In this project we will be performing an exploratory analysis on large csv files.   We will analyze all the rideshare data of PyBer, a ride-sharing app company, from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualizations for the CEO to help drive strategy.

### Purpose:

The purpose of the analysis is to create visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.


### Current situation:

PYber is a python based ride-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion.  The CEO of the company needs the analysis to make strategic decisions regarding affordability for certain neighborhoods.

### Overview of approach:

Using Pandas library, Jupiter Notebook, and Matplotlib we were able to read, merge, and create visualizations of two large csv files located on the Resources folder; city_data.csv and ride_data.csv. The charts created show the relationship between the type of city and drivers, riders, and fares.  These visualizations are located on the analysis and Resources folders.


## ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

1. Revenue Throughout Time:  In the following graph we can observe how our main revenue stream comes from services provided in **Urban cities**, following by Suburban, and rural.  In the **third week of February** we can observe a significant increase in revenue along the three types of cities.  Regarding the overall increase throughout time; from January to May, **Urban cities show an overall increase in revenue as time passes** despite some variations.  Revenue coming from Suburban cities has remained steady with a tendency to increase. Finally, the rural cities' revenue has had some lows and highs but in general is steady.
