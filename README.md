# PyBer Analysis

## OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

### Description:

In this project we will be performing an exploratory analysis on two large csv files.   We will analyze all the rideshare data of PyBer, a ride-sharing app company, from **January to April of 2019** and create a compelling visualizations for the CEO to help drive strategy.

### Purpose:

The purpose of the analysis is to create visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.


### Current situation:

PYber is a python based ride-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion.  The CEO of the company needs the analysis to make strategic decisions regarding affordability for certain neighborhoods.

### Overview of approach:

Using Pandas library, Jupiter Notebook, and Matplotlib we were able to read, merge, and create visualizations of two large csv files located in the Resources folder; city_data.csv and ride_data.csv. The charts created show the relationship between the type of city and drivers, riders, and fares.  These visualizations are located on the analysis and Resources folders and consist of line charts, bubble charts, Box-and-Whisker plots, and Pie charts. The code used can be found in the file PyBer_Challenge.ipynb


## ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

**1. Revenue Throughout Time :**  

In the following graph we can observe how our main revenue stream comes from services provided in **Urban cities**, followed by Suburban, and rural respectively.

In the **third week of February** we can observe a significant increase in revenue along the three types of cities.  

**Urban cities show the largest overall increase in revenue from January through April**.  Revenue coming from Suburban cities has remained steady with a tendency to increase. Finally, **the rural cities' revenue has not increased**.

**2. Number of Rides in relationship with Fare:**

In the following graph, the size of the bubbles represent the number of drivers per city.  In the X-axis are the number of rides by city and in the Y-axis are the fares.  

We can observe that **Urban cities have on average the greatest number of drivers**, and **Rural the smallest**.  

Despite that **Urban** cities have the greatest number of rides **their fares are the lowest** among the three. 

Finally, **Rural cities have the lowest number of drivers, significantly higher fares compared to Urban cities, and the least rides.

**3. Number of Rides by City Type:**

Looking at the box-and-whisker plot we can see that **the median number of rides in Urban cities (24) is the greatest**, followed by Suburban (17), and Rural (6). 

Urban cities shows the highest distance between the ends of the three whiskers for each boxplot.  This means that the **range of the data** for that city type is the **largest**.  Number of rides for Urban cities may have **values going from 12 to 39 rides per city**. Finally, there is at least one outlier in the Urban cities, which is close to 40.

In the time analyzed **Rural cities** have **the smallest number of rides per city** and therefore a narrower range. Number of rides have taken **values between 3 to 13**.

The range for Suburban cities goes from 9 to 27.
